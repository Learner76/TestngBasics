Regarding --------------------------Set up--------------------------------
Created maven project, as Testng has multiple transitive jar dependancy. Difficult to add externally.
Use Archetype:quickstart to get maven project structure and pom.xml.
Added Testng Dependancy in POM.xml and maven reload.
Add run configuration, Add Testng plugin and create configuration.
Create basic class and run.

Regarding ---------------------------<test> vs @Test-----------------------
@Test denotes single test, where in <test> has bigger scope, it can group @test from
multiple classes and run them together. so <test> is a big container.


Regarding ---------------------------Reports-------------------------------
TestNG Default Reports are focused on Test Execution, not Fixtures.
Hence HTMLReporter or TestNGReport will not have any logs from Before and Methods. DO remember this.
Reproter.log() also have same behaviour if used in @Before or @After method, will not log in final Report.
So that reason we can use customer listner.

Regarding -------------------------Testng.xml---------------------------------
Suite->Test -->Classes ->Class order for basic xml.
<suite name ="abc">
    <test name ="def">
        <classes>
            <class name="org.example.Ex_1_Testng_basic">
            </class>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
